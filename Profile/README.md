# Welcome to the GitHub organization for the Space, Automation, Manufacturing Mechanisms lab at University of Florida.  

### If you are a member of the Spring 2023 Smart Manufacturing class, you will find that you have access to the class resources repository, a ROS/MoveIt demo repository, and a few (currently 9) other repositories that are forks of other public repositories.  You don't need to give any attention to the forked repositories unless you are interested in that code too.
